## Questions
<br>

#### Question-1: Countdown Blastoff (While Loop)

Create a program that simulates a rocket launch countdown using a while loop. Start from 10 and countdown to "Blastoff!" with a one-second delay between each countdown number. Print a message when the rocket launches.

**Hint:** You may want to use `cat` command to print the countdown and `Sys.sleep` for incorporating the delay

**Output preview:** Here is how the countdown could look like 

```{r, out.height= "200px",out.width= "600px",echo=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/angel/Downloads/10.webp")
```



**Solutions:**

```{r, eval=T,echo=TRUE}
# Enter code here
countdown <- function() {
  count <- 10
  
  while (count >= 1) {
    cat(count, "\n")
    Sys.sleep(1)  # Delay for one second
    count <- count - 1
  }
  
  cat("Blastoff!\nRocket has launched!\n")
}

countdown()

```
```{r, out.height= "200px",out.width= "600px",echo=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/angel/Downloads/garrett-reisman-nasa-hero.webp")
```

#### Question-2: Word Reverser (for Loop)

Develop a program that takes a user-entered word and uses a while loop to print the word's characters in reverse order. For example, if the user enters "hello," the program should print "olleh."

**Hint:** You may want to use `substr` command to access each character of the input word, and `paste` command to join the reversed letters one at a time

**Solutions:** 

```{r, eval=T,echo=TRUE}
# Enter code here
reverse_word <- function() {
  word <- "nuggets"
  reversed <- ""
  i <- nchar(word)
  
  while (i > 0) {
    reversed <- paste(reversed, substr(word, i, i), sep = "")
    i <- i - 1
  }
  
  cat("Reversed word:", reversed, "\n")
}

reverse_word()


```
